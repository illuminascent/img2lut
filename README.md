# img2lut
Creates 3dlut via an image

# What this does
The idea is really simple.

Think about how 3D LUTs are just representations of transformations.

This project will allow for generating an image that contains (almost) all possible RGB combinations. And the functionality that analyses the result of such image being transformed by any color grading process. For smartphone apps, grading softwares, or whatever that will modify the look of an image and LET YOU SAVE THE RESULT, you can make a 3dlut that resembles exactly that modification process.
